# Welcome to ERNIE_Plus
ERNIE_Plus is a re-incarnation of ERNIE. I forked the ERNIE repo on May 16, 2020 and created a new ERNIE_PLus folder that will serve as root level directory for code develope after this day. More information on ERNIE can be found at https://netesolutions.github.io/ernie_homepage/
